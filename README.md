# FRET_Tracking
This software is used to analyze FRET trajectories of a donor diffusing in a dense anisotropic film deposited on a plane of randomly coated acceptor for the purpose of characterizing the transport properties normal to the surface.  Full details, derivations, and instructions can be found in the manuscript and corresponding supplemental material, and detailed descriptions of the inputs and outputs can be found in the included .m files.  An example data set is also included as a model of the input format. The software has been tested with Matlab 2019a, and requires the global optimization toolbox. The Parallel computing toolbox is also recommended for shorter run times.
